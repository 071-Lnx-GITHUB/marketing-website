    Traditional statistics were developed over 100 years ago, for an offline world. These methods are no longer up to the task of helping businesses make decisions with real-time data. If you look at results in real time, as most optimization platforms allow you to do, youâ€™ll see winning results where no winner actually exists.

    Without taking precautions, like setting a sample size and committing to a minimum detectable effect in advance, you could make changes to your website or product that at best, have no impact, and at worst, could be hurting your bottom line.
