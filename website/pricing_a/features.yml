faqs:
  -
    question: "How are monthly unique visitors counted?"
    answer: "Monthly unique visitors are counted by adding the number of unique visitors in an experiment on the web to the number of unique visitors in an experiment in a mobile app. You can distribute the unique visitor allocation however you like."
  -
    question: "What amount of coding knowledge is required to use Optimizely?"
    answer: "Once the Optimizely Snippet or SDK is installed, you can get started optimizing without technical expertise using a visual editor for both websites and mobile apps. Optimizely is also very developer-friendly, with features that enable custom experiments and advanced targeting for a range of use cases."
  -
    question: "What will I need to install on my website or in my mobile app?"
    answer: "Implementation for the web takes one line of JavaScript on every page you want to optimize. On mobile, a similar one-time SDK implementation is all that’s required to start running experiments."
  -
    question: "I signed up for Optimizely's Bronze, Silver, or Gold plan. What do these new plans mean for me?"
    answer: "As a current customer, you are grandfathered into the original plan you selected. You can continue to use this plan, or select a new plan if you feel Starter or Enterprise better meets your needs. You can find more answers in this FAQ."
  -
    question: "Does Optimizely offer nonprofit pricing?"
    answer: "Yes. Visit Optimizely for non-profits for more information."
  -
    question: "I have more questions. Where can I find answers?"
