- "Optimizely's visual editor and testing environment enable the easy creation and discovery of optimal combinations of content placement, size, headlines, images, and more. Easily define and achieve any goals, from higher click through rates, longer site visits, to downloads, or boosts in engagement."
- "Most people on our team found it hard to believe that a single word could really have a meaningful impact on user behavior. Prior to Optimizely, testing usually meant more people needed to be involved, which made for a longer process, and didn't typically allow for a quick and easy test; it didn't take more than a day to discover that the naysayers were totally wrong."
