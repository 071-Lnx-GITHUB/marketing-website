        question: What amount of technical expertise is required to use Optimizely?
        answer: |
             <p>Minimal technical expertise is necessary to use Optimizely.  We have built a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor for making A/B tests.  Simply load your website in the editor, click on an element, and make your changes.  You can even <a href="/edit#url=www.google.com"> try the editor for yourself</a>.</p>
             <p>For power users, we also provide the ability to write custom variation code with JavaScript. For more information, see <a href="https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039835"> this knowledge base article </a>.</p>
