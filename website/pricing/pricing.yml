faqs:
  -
    question: "How are monthly unique visitors counted?"
    answer: "Monthly unique visitors are counted by adding the number of unique visitors in an experiment on the web to the number of unique visitors in an experiment in a mobile app. You can distribute the unique visitor allocation however you like."
  -
    question: "What amount of coding knowledge is required to use Optimizely?"
    answer: "Once the Optimizely Snippet or SDK is installed, you can get started optimizing without technical expertise using a visual editor for both websites and mobile apps. Optimizely is also very developer-friendly, with features that enable custom experiments and advanced targeting for a range of use cases."
  -
    question: "What will I need to install on my website or in my mobile app?"
    answer: "Implementation for the web takes one line of JavaScript on every page you want to optimize. On mobile, a similar one-time SDK implementation is all that’s required to start running experiments."
  -
    question: "I signed up for Optimizely's Bronze, Silver, or Gold plan. What do these new plans mean for me?"
    answer: "As a current customer, you are grandfathered into the original plan you selected. You can continue to use this plan, or select a new plan if you feel Starter or Enterprise better meets your needs. You can find more answers in this FAQ."
  -
    question: "Does Optimizely offer nonprofit pricing?"
    answer: "Yes. Visit <a href='https://www.optimizely.com/nonprofits'>Optimizely for non-profits</a> for more information."
  -
    question: "I have more questions. Where can I find answers?"
    answer: "Check out our Knowledge Base for questions about how Optimizely works on your website or mobile app. If you have questions about an enterprise plan, please get in touch by calling or filling out a form. We’ll get back to you!"
