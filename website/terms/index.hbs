            <h4 class="padding-top">10. Confidentiality</h4>
            <p>
              “Confidential Information” of either party will mean information disclosed to or learned by the receiving party concerning the disclosing party’s business, customers, products, proposed products, plans, inventions, processes and techniques, which is designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or some similar designation or should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary due to its nature or the context of its disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach on the part of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party obtains from a third party rightfully, without breach of nondisclosure obligations and without restriction on disclosure; or (iii) the disclosing party regularly provides to others without restriction on disclosure. Except as explicitly authorized in writing by this Agreement or otherwise, each party will: (a) not use, for its own benefit or the benefit of any third party, the other party's Confidential Information; and (b) use all reasonable care, but in no event less care than it takes to protect its own Confidential Information of similar importance, to protect the other party's Confidential Information from unauthorized use, disclosure and publication. Both parties acknowledge that the breach of this Section 12 could cause great or irreparable injury to the disclosing party and that pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief, and therefore, that upon any such unauthorized disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. Within five (5) days after termination of this Agreement, each receiving party shall destroy or deliver to the disclosing party, at the disclosing party’s option, all materials in receiving party’s possession or control that contain or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.

              No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Optimizely's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>F. Export Restrictions</strong></h5>
            <p>
              You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to United States export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.

              You shall be responsible for handling and processing notices of alleged infringement by Customer Properties in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (or any successors thereto or similar laws in foreign jurisdictions) (“DMCA”) and shall promptly notify Optimizely if you become aware of any such notices or takedown requests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without limiting Optimizely’s other rights and remedies hereunder, Optimizely reserves the right to respond to any DMCA notices it receives in accordance with its DMCA policies and to suspend or terminate access to the Service for repeat infringers.
