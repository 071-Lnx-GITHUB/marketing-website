            description: "Industry investment into real-time programmatic bidding is growing.
              Without the proper tracking and monitoring setup, optimization efforts start to
              lose their impact and even worse, can yield incorrect results. Managing the investment
              into programmatic while maintaining reliable control over tracking and yield
              management is difficult. This talk will help firms grow their programmatic efforts
              in a controlled manner, while still maintaining A/B and conversion funnel optimization
              rigor. Points of discussion: 1) Tracking and scaling a programmatic marketing program
              via a variety of ad platforms (notably - Google and Facebook). 2) Customer and A/B
              segmentation 3) Audience management through a DMP 4) Performance feedback of A/B and
              its effect on bid optimization."
