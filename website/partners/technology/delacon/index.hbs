##### Company

Delacon has extensive expertise in developing leading-edge telecommunication technologies including a world-class call tracking solution.

##### Integration

Delacon allows you to analyze call data from split tested pages within Optimizely. When combining the data from telephone calls and submission form clicks, you will be able to make fully informed decisions based on all the available data. Call data is captured by adding extra tracking code to each variation and creating an Optimizely custom event goal. Call data can also be analyzed in Delacon's reports and in Google Analytics.
