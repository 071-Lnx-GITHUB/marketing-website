##### Company

Amplitude's mobile & web analytics platform helps product and marketing teams drill down on user behavior and drive growth. In addition to standard analytics functions like tracking actions, funnels, and retention, Amplitudeâ€™s platform produces real user insights via data science tools like behavior-based cohorting to truly understand the drivers of growth.

##### Integration

Track Optimizely experiments and variation names directly in your Amplitude data. Optimizely will automatically populate an Amplitude User Property to all events triggered for a particular user. Measure the impact of your experiments by segmenting your Amplitude funnels, retention, etc. by variations your users were exposed to.
