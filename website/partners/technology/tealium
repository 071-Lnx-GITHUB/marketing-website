##### Company

Tealium is the leader in enterprise tag management and digital data distribution platforms. Tealium gives marketers a comprehensive solution for managing their third-party digital marketing vendor tags, and then correlating the data those tags generate into a clean, actionable source.
 

##### Integration
Optimizely now has an integration with Tealium AudienceStream, which allows you to use visitor data collected by AudienceStream and use it to create Audiences in Optimizely. From there, you can run targeted tests and personalization campaigns based on real-time data points such as cart abandonment, product interest, and content engagement.
