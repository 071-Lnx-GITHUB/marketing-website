COMPANY
Crazy Egg shows you exactly where people are clicking on your site. You can see at a glance what's "hot" and what's not. We have a scrollmap tool shows you how far down people are scrolling and helps determine where visitors abandon the page. You'll pinpoint what areas your audience loves and what needs improvement. You can also see where different traffic sources click on your site. This makes identifying your most profitable traffic source - and optimizing your site - extremely simple. You get all that data you need in a clear, easy-to-understand visual way so you'll know exactly what needs improvement.

INTEGRATION

The integration allows you to create Crazy Egg (heatmap) snapshots of your experiments. It also makes sure visitors get attributed to the proper snapshot based on the active experiments you are running.
