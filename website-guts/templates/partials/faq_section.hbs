    <p class="question">How are monthly unique visitors counted?</p>
    <p class="answer">Monthly unique visitors are counted by adding the number of unique visitors in an experiment on the web to the number of unique visitors in an experiment in a mobile app. You can distribute the unique visitor allocation however you like.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What amount of coding knowledge is required to use Optimizely?</p>
    <p class="answer">Once the Optimizely Snippet or SDK is installed, you can get started optimizing without technical expertise using a visual editor for both websites and mobile apps. Optimizely is also very developer-friendly, with features that enable custom experiments and advanced targeting for a range of use cases.</p>
    
    <p class="question">What will I need to install on my website or in my mobile app?</p>
    <p class="answer">Implementation for the web takes one line of JavaScript on every page you want to optimize. On mobile, a similar one-time SDK implementation is all that’s required to start running experiments.</p>
    
    <p class="question">I signed up for Optimizely&#x27;s Bronze, Silver, or Gold plan. What do these new plans mean for me?</p>
