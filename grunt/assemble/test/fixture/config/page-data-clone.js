It is based on the formula used in <a href=\"http://www.optimizely.com/statistics/\">Optimizely’s Stats Engine</a>. Stats Engine calculates statistical significance using sequential testing and false discovery rate controls. When combined, these two techniques mean you no longer need to wait for a pre-set sample size to ensure the validity of your results.

In other words, it is the smallest relative change in conversion rate you are interested in detecting. For example, if your baseline conversion rate is 20%, and you set an MDE of 10%, your test would detect any changes that move your conversion rate outside the absolute range of 18% to 22% (a 10% relative effect is a 2% absolute change in conversion rate in this example). <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200133789-How-long-to-run-a-test#minimum\">Learn more</a></p>\n"},{"TR_sub_title":"How do I estimate a value for minimum detectable effect (MDE)?","HTML_description":"<p> Decide how willing you are to trade off sensitivity of your test versus how long you might need to run your test for.

With the right strategy and the right tools, conversion optimization becomes a science and a culture. Starting with a clearly defined hypothesis, each stage of the strategy provides valuable, actionable data to produce the best results possible for your website.</p>\n<p> In this article, we’ll look at the five tools that, when combined, can lay the foundation for a complete conversion optimization strategy, and ensure that you’re always maximizing your ROI.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-a-b-testing-platform\">1. A/B Testing Platform</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/ab-icon.png\" alt=\"A/b testing tool\"> A/B testing is the bread and butter of conversion rate optimization (CRO). In a nutshell, an A/B test allows you to pit multiple versions of a web page against one another and funnel your site traffic into each version to determine which design results in a more successful user experience. Do more people click the “Add to cart button” in version A or version B, for example.</p>\n<p> Although the idea of an A/B test is simple, the right A/B testing service makes it easy and fun to run many tests quickly and immediately start watching results pour in about how visitors react to different variations.</p>\n<p> A/B testing platforms thrive and ignite your CRO strategies when integrated with other services. Integrating with an analytics service can give you many more specific details on how each variation performed. Many testing platforms offer integrations that allow for advanced custom goals and tracking. To really take advantage of the explosive amount of data coming in through your A/B test results, try pairing your A/B testing platform with the next tool on the list, an analytics service.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-analytics-services\">2. Analytics Services</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/analytics-icon.png\" alt=\"Analytics services\"> Analytics services are some of the most well-developed tools of web marketing, and as such, most analytics tools have become extremely comprehensive. Even a free tool can usually provide comprehensive data on where your traffic comes from, the path visitors take through the site, how long they stay on each page, and much more. The sheer amount of data can be overwhelming so don’t worry about tracking everything at once — build slowly!</p>\n<p> Once integrated with your A/B testing platform, you can see how the traffic segments that saw each page variation behaved. Information such as bounce rates, site paths and time on page for each page variation are all measurable with analytics. With an integration this powerful, you’ll quickly find your analytics service indispensable and look to integrate more services.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-marketing-automation-platform\">3. Marketing Automation Platform</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/marketing-icon.png\" alt=\"Marketing automation platforms\"></p>\n<p> The Marketing Automation Platform is the engine that fuels the process of turning a simple lead into a new client. An automated marketing machine involves automating and measuring all of the communication between you and your prospect customer. A new lead can be classified and added to an email program automatically, sent to the correct member of the sales team, and much more.</p>\n<p> Linking your A/B tested pages with different marketing campaigns, you can gauge the quantity and quality of leads coming from them. When testing a lead generation page, ask yourself these questions: how does the number of form fields impact lead quantity/quality? Will higher qualified leads fill out forms with more fields?</p>\n<p> Keeping track of both of these metrics, lead quality and lead quantity, is important for scaling your business long term. If a certain page variation increases quantity but seriously decreases quality, maybe it’s not a smart change for the long term. Integrating a Marketing Automation Platform to your A/B tests and analytics tools results in faster, more nimble organization, with greater efficiency and insight for everyone involved.</p>\n<h4 id=\"4-heat-mapping-service\">4. Heat Mapping Service</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/heatmap-icon.png\" alt=\"Heatmapping service\"> Heat mapping tools provide possibly the most direct insight into how visitors interact with your website. By monitoring mouse clicks and other manipulations of the page (such as scrolling), a heat map provides you with a clear picture of where users spend the most time on your page and where they don’t.</p></p>\n<p> Heat maps can help you decide which elements on your page to optimize. Before you even think about optimization, try examining the heat map of that web page. Get a sense of how visitors are engaging, clicking, and navigating the page.

Internet businesses measure successful conversions differently based on the nature of their business and their goals. An online publisher might consider submitting a form on a subscription page a successful conversion; whereas an online retailer might measure their conversion rate by number of clicks to the “Add to Cart” button. Internet businesses in every industry employ many methods to improve conversion rates because higher conversion rates typically translate to greater return on investment. This article outlines five tips and approaches to improving conversion rates using an <a href=\"http://www.optimizely.com\">A/B testing software</a>.</p></p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-1-focus-on-your-call-to-action-\">Tip 1: Focus on your call to action.</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/click-me.png\" alt=\"Focus on your call to action\"> In online marketing lingo, a call to action refers to a button or link that directs visitors to take a certain action like “Add to Cart” or “Register Now.” One way to potentially improve conversion rates is to experiment with different calls to action. Vary not only the position on the page. Try new CTA text or icon on the button as well.</p>\n<p> In one experiment, Optimizely was able to increase conversion rates on the homepage 27% by changing the call to action button text from “Get Started” to “Test It Out.” The hypothesis was that action words would perform better than non-action words and that less process-oriented wording would do better. Seeing a significant increase in conversion rate from “Test It Out,” we concluded that this language made it more clear that the user could try it immediately without a long process. We thought “Get Started” presented a more hands-on, involved process.</p>\n<p> By testing the CTA on your pages, you may reveal how much impact just three words can have on your bottom line.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-2-experiment-with-layout-content-style-and-functionality-on-landing-pages\">Tip 2: Experiment with Layout, Content, Style and Functionality on Landing Pages</h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/layout-icon.png\" alt=\"Experiment with layout\"> Landing pages typically do three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They inform the user what your company has to offer.</li>\n<li>They interest you in their offer, often by explaining what makes your company different.</li>\n<li><p>They make it easy and clear how the user can follow through on your offer (i.e. “convert”).</p>\n<p>In other words, landing pages give enough information to motivate users to want to convert and gently guide them in that direction. Your content, layout, style and functionality are all a part of this. For example, a page with too much content may confuse users but a page without enough or the wrong kind of content might not motivate them to convert. Experiment with the position of page elements. Vary the text and images. See what happens if you make stylistic changes to page elements. Ask yourself questions like: does the text field have to be long? Should the call to action be a different color? Finally, try different user experiences and change functionality.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-3-track-multiple-page-elements-\">Tip 3: Track multiple page elements.</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/track-icon.png\" alt=\"Track multiple page elements\"> Keep in mind the reason you’re testing: you want to achieve a certain goal or goals. Many factors may affect the success of achieving your goal whether it be increasing views, sign-ups, leads, revenue, downloads or a combination of these. Tracking multiple elements on the pages you’re testing helps measure how your tests impact the different ways a visitor could achieve the goal. You will not only be able to learn which experience was better by tracking multiple elements, but also possibly learn why it was better for your site visitors.</p>\n<p>For example, a software site has a goal to create more sales leads for their sales team. A visitor can become a lead in three ways:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Watching a video on the homepage that prompts them to “learn more” by filling out a form</p>\n</li>\n<li>Clicking on the “take the guided tour” button which ends in a form to create an account</li>\n<li><p>Directly signing up for a 30-day free trial from the pricing page</p>\n<p>The company runs A/B tests to hopefully increase the number visitors who convert into leads. They track clicks on all three lead-generation sources to measure if and how any variation impacts that source. Maybe advertising the 30-day free trial detracts from visitors who become a lead via watching the video. Tracking clicks on both buttons will give the full picture on how to best optimize the page to achieve the ultimate goal of increasing leads.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-4-test-the-right-visitors-\">Tip 4: Test the right visitors.</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/test-icon.png\" alt=\"Test the right visitors\"> Different visitors behave differently. For example, organic visitors tend to spend more time on websites, view more pages, and have lower bounce rates than visitors that come from paid campaigns. Similarly, returning visitors tend to browse sites differently from new visitors. These behavioral differences should be reflected in your testing parameters. Design tests that are aimed at the right people.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-5-iterate-iterate-and-iterate-\">Tip 5: Iterate, iterate, and iterate.</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/iterate-icon.png\" alt=\"Iterate\"> This tip is also known as “always be testing.” The nature of experimentation dictates that some tests succeed and some fail: both outcomes present opportunities for growth. The road to improved conversion rates is paved with lots of tests. Use testing as a chance to explore new design possibilities then refine.

The experiment is delivered to a selected percentage of the application’s install base. App users are randomly distributed between the original and variation experiences without knowing they are part of a test. Once a statistically significant difference in user behavior emerges, the results of each variation are compared to determine which performed best against the predetermined goal.</p>\n<p> This method can be used to test changes across any aspect of an application where a measurable goal can be improved, including including user interface (UI), onboarding flow, content and messaging, and many more. For example, testing changes to an app’s first time user experience, or onboarding flow, would help determine what factors improve conversions through each step of the onboarding process and will lead to increased retention over time.</p>\n<p> iOS A/B testing can also be used to experiment with new features and releases to measure their impact before submitting them for App Store approval. This phased rollout process is made possible through Code Blocks, which encapsulate a new experience into a conditional code statement that allows one to deliver that experience to a controlled percentage of an app’s install base.</p>\n<h5 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h5>\n<p> A/B testing allows iOS developers, marketers, and product managers to gather data about their install base and use that data to serve up higher converting, optimized experiences. This process of experience optimization helps mobile teams achieve key business goals, such as engagement, retention, and monetization.</p>\n<p> A/B testing makes it easy for testers to demonstrate return on investment (ROI), because tests are created with a quantifiable goal in mind and results are easy to track and measure. Teams become more efficient, as testing ensures developers and designers focus their time building experiences that are proven to convert.</p>\n<h5 id=\"what-elements-can-be-tested\">What Elements Can Be Tested</h5>\n<p> All categories of iOS applications can benefits from A/B testing, and depending on the app, teams may prioritize testing different elements. Within the app, nearly every element can be altered and tested. Product managers, marketers, and app developers often experiment with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Visual elements:</b> Pictures, videos, and colors</li>\n<li><b>Text:</b> Headlines, calls to action, and descriptions</li>\n<li><b>Layout:</b> Arrangement and size of buttons, navigation, and forms</li>\n<li><b>Onboarding:</b> How a first time user engages with your app</li>\n<li><b>User flow:</b> How a user gets from point A to B within your app</li>\n<li><b>New features and releases:</b> The latest version or update from your app</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"best-practices-for-ios-a-b-testing\">Best Practices for iOS A/B Testing</h5>\n<p> While there is no tried and true formula for building the perfect app experience, best practices can be used as an starting point when considering what to test. Some iOS A/B testing best practices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Eliminate distractions:</b> Mobile users want to get from point A to point B quickly. Use limited screen real estate wisely to keep them focused and engaged on the task at hand. Fewer elements create less distraction from the conversion goal.</li>\n<li><b>Focus on the call to action:</b> Call-to-action text and placement resonate differently depending on the audience</li>\n<li><b>Show, don’t tell:</b> Too much text can create friction for app users. Instead of text, focus on immersing users in an interactive app experience that leads to deeper engagement.</li>\n<li><b>Aim for the global maximum:</b> Test with the overarching goal of the iOS application in mind, not the goals of individual screens or elements</li>\n<li><b>Provide consistent experiences:</b> Make testing changes consistent throughout the user flow to improve conversions at every step of the process. If you have a web experience, make sure users see a consistent experience across devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"optimizely\">Optimizely</h5>\n<p> Optimizely is a platform that makes iOS A/B testing easy, allowing users to build, create, and measure, and connect experiences across devices.

Let’s take a look at the methodology, common uses, advantages, and limitations of these testing methods.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-b-testing\">A/B Testing</h4>\n<p> A/B testing, which you may also have heard referred to as split testing, is a method of website optimization in which the conversion rates of two versions of a page — version A and version B — are compared to one another using live traffic. Site visitors are bucketed into one version or the other. By tracking the way visitors interact with the page they are shown — the videos they watch, the buttons they click, or whether or not they sign up for a newsletter — you can determine which version of the page is most effective.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/ab-flow-cta.png\" alt=\"Tracks clicks on CTA\"></p>\n<h5 id=\"common-uses\">Common Uses</h5>\n<p> A/B testing is the least complex method of evaluating a page design, and is useful in a variety of situations.</p>\n<p> One of the most common ways A/B testing is utilized is to test two very different design directions against one another. For example, the current version of a company’s home page might have in-text calls to action, while the new version might eliminate most text, but include a new top bar advertising the latest product. After enough visitors have been funneled to both pages, the number of clicks on each page’s version of the call to action can be compared. It’s important to note that even though many design elements are changed in this kind of A/B test, only the impact of the design as a whole on each page’s business goal is tracked, not individual elements.</p>\n<p> A/B testing is also useful as an optimization option for pages where only one element is up for debate. For example, a pet store running an A/B test on their site might find that 85% more users are willing to sign up for a newsletter held up by a cartoon mouse than they are for one emerging from the coils of a boa constrictor. When A/B testing is used in this way, a third or even fourth version of the page is often included in the test, which is sometimes called an A/B/C/D test. This, of course, means that traffic to the site must be split into thirds or fourths, with a lesser percentage of visitors visiting each site.</p>\n<h5 id=\"advantages\">Advantages</h5>\n<p> Simple in concept and design, A/B testing is a powerful and widely used testing method.</p>\n<p> Keeping the number of tracked variables small means these tests can deliver reliable data very quickly, as they do not require a large amount of traffic to run. This is especially helpful if your site has a small number of daily visitors.  Splitting traffic into more than three or four segments would make it hard to finish a test. In fact, A/B testing is so speedy and easy to interpret that some large sites use it as their primary testing method, running cycles of tests one after another rather than more complex multivariate tests.</p>\n<p> A/B testing is also a good way to introduce the concept of optimization through testing to a skeptical team, as it can quickly demonstrate the quantifiable impact of a simple design change.</p>\n<h5 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h5>\n<p> A/B testing is a versatile tool, and when paired with smart experiment design and a commitment to iterative cycles of testing and redesign, it can help you make huge improvements to your site. However, it is important to remember that the limitations of this kind of test are summed up in the name. A/B testing is best used to measure the impact of two to four variables on interactions with the page. Tests with more variables take longer to run, and in and of itself, A/B testing will not reveal any information about interaction between variables on a single page.</p>\n<p> If you need information about how many different elements interact with one another, multivariate testing is the optimal approach!</p>\n<h4 id=\"multivariate-testing\">Multivariate Testing</h4>\n<p> Multivariate testing uses the same core mechanism as A/B testing, but compares a higher number of variables, and reveals more information about how these variables interact with one another. As in an A/B test, traffic to a page is split between different versions of the design. The purpose of a multivariate test, then, is to measure the effectiveness each design combination has on the ultimate goal.</p>\n<p> Once a site has received enough traffic to run the test, the data from each variation is compared to find not only the most successful design, but also to potentially reveal which elements have the greatest positive or negative impact on a visitor’s interaction.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/mvt_browser-table.png\" alt=\"Browser\"></p>\n<h5 id=\"common-uses\">Common Uses</h5>\n<p> The most commonly cited example of multivariate testing is a page on which several elements are up for debate — for example, a page that includes a sign-up form, some kind of catchy header text, and a footer. To run a multivariate test on this page, rather than creating a radically different design as in A/B testing, you might create two different lengths of sign-up form, three different headlines, and two footers. Next, you would funnel visitors to all possible combinations of these elements. This is also known as full factorial testing, and is one of the reasons why multivariate testing is often recommended only for sites that have a substantial amount of daily traffic — the more variations that need to be tested, the longer it takes to obtain meaningful data from the test.</p>\n<p> After the test has been run, the variables on each page variation are compared to each other, and to their performance in the context of other versions of the test. What emerges is a clear picture of which page is best performing, and which elements are most responsible for this performance. For example, varying a page footer may be shown to have very little effect on the performance of the page, while varying the length of the sign-up form has a huge impact.</p>\n<h5 id=\"advantages\">Advantages</h5>\n<p> Multivariate testing is a powerful way to help you target redesign efforts to the elements of your page where they will have the most impact. This is especially useful when designing landing page campaigns, for example, as the data about the impact of a certain element’s design can be applied to future campaigns, even if the context of the element has changed.</p>\n<h5 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h5>\n<p> The single biggest limitation of multivariate testing is the amount of traffic needed to complete the test. Since all experiments are fully factorial, too many changing elements at once can quickly add up to a very large number of possible combinations that must be tested. Even a site with fairly high traffic might have trouble completing a test with more than 25 combinations in a feasible amount of time.</p>\n<p> When using multivariate tests, it’s also important to consider how they will fit into your cycle of testing and redesign as a whole. Even when you are armed with information about the impact of a particular element, you may want to do additional A/B testing cycles to explore other radically different ideas. Also, sometimes it may not be worth the extra time necessary to run a full multivariate test when several well-designed A/B tests will do the job well.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The Bottom Line</h4>\n<p> Don’t let the differences between A/B testing and multivariate testing make you think of them as opposites. Instead, think of them as two powerful optimization methods that complement one another. Pick one or the other, or use them both together to help you get the most out of your site.</p>\n","layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/seo":{"layout_script":"seo.js","layout_body_class":["seo-layout"],"TR_layout_header":"Start using Optimizely to test your website today!"}}},"/website/resources/multivariate-testing/index":{"TR_seo_title":"What is Multivariate Testing?","TR_visible_title":"What is Multivariate Testing?","HTML_page_content":"<h3 id=\"multivariate-tests-defined\">Multivariate Tests Defined</h3>\n<p> Multivariate testing is a technique for testing a hypothesis in which multiple variables are modified. The goal of multivariate testing is to determine which combination of variations performs the best out of all of the possible combinations.</p>\n<p> Websites and mobile apps are made of combinations of changeable elements. A multivariate test will change multiple elements, like changing a picture and headline at the same time. Three variations of the image and two variations of the headline are combined to create six versions of the content, which are tested concurrently to find the winning variation.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/optimizely-marketer-assets/pages/seo/mvt_browser.png\" alt=\"Headline and image to test.\"></p>\n<p> The total number of variations in a multivariate test will always be:</p>\n<p> <b>[# of Variations on Element A] X [# of Variations on Element B] …. = [Total # of Variations]</b></p>\n<p> In the example below, the headline and image are tested in combination, with a baseline and one variation for each element generating four total variations for the experiment.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/optimizely-marketer-assets/pages/seo/mvt_table.png\" alt=\"Combinations of headline and image.\"></p>\n<p> The process of running a multivariate test is <a href=\"/dist/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test\">similar to A/B split testing</a>, but different in that A/B testing only tests one variable. In an A/B test, a minimum of one variable is tested to determine the effect of a change to one variable. In a multivariate test, multiple variables are tested together to uncover the ideal combination that is effective in improving the ultimate goal.</p>\n<h5 id=\"benefits-of-multivariate-testing\">Benefits of Multivariate Testing</h5>\n<p> Using multivariate testing can be helpful when multiple elements on the same page can be changed in tandem to improve a single conversion goal: sign ups, clicks, form completions, or shares. If conducted properly, a multivariate test can eliminate the need to run several sequential A/B tests on the same page with the same goal. Instead, the tests are run concurrently with a greater number of variations in a shorter period of time.</p>\n<h5 id=\"downsides-of-multivariate-testing\">Downsides of Multivariate Testing</h5>\n<p> The most difficult challenge in executing multivariate tests is the amount of visitor traffic required to reach meaningful results. Because of the fully factorial nature of these tests, the number of variations in a test can add up quickly. The result of a many-variation test is that the allocated traffic to each variation is lower. In A/B testing, traffic for an experiment is split in half, with 50 percent of traffic visiting each variation. In a multivariate test, traffic will be split into quarters, sixths, eighths, or even smaller segments, with variations receiving a much smaller portion of traffic than in a simple A/B test.</p>\n<p> Before running a multivariate test, project the traffic sample size that you will need for each variation in order to reach a statistically significant result. If traffic to the page you would like to test is low, consider using an A/B test instead of a multivariate test.</p>\n<p> Another challenge of multivariate testing is when one or more of the variables being tested do not have a measurable effect on the conversion goal. For instance, if variations of an image on a landing page do not affect the conversion goal, while modifications to a headline do, the test would have been more effective run as an A/B test rather than a multivariate test.</p>\n<h5 id=\"examples-of-multivariate-testing\">Examples of Multivariate Testing</h5>\n<p> Common examples of multivariate tests include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing text and visual elements on a webpage together</li>\n<li>Testing the text and color of a CTA button together</li>\n<li>Testing the number of form fields and CTA text together</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Using multivariate testing as a method of website optimization is a powerful method of gathering visitor and user data that gives detailed insights into complex customer behavior.

Of the visitors that convert into paying customers, further analysis can be done to determine which channels are most effective at acquiring valuable customers.</p>\n<p> Analytics for web or mobile app experiences can help determine the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which online marketing channels are the most cost-effective at acquiring customers, based on the conversion rate of visitors to customers, and the cost of those visitors.</li>\n<li>Which channels are effective at acquiring and driving higher lifetime value for customers—such as email marketing, which drives repeat purchases to prior customers.</li>\n<li>Which cohorts of customers exhibit strong engagement behavior and high potential for upsells—such as software or mobile apps, which expect to sell more products to customers with high engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"tools\">Tools</h5>\n<p> There are a number of tools that can be used to build and maintain a robust online marketing program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email marketing</li>\n<li>Social media marketing</li>\n<li>SEO (search engine optimization)</li>\n<li>Display advertising</li>\n<li>SEM (search engine marketing)</li>\n<li>Events &amp; webinars</li>\n<li>A/B Testing &amp; optimization</li>\n<li>Content marketing</li>\n<li>Video marketing</li>\n<li>Marketing analytics</li>\n<li>Marketing automation</li>\n<li>CRM (customer relationship management)</li>\n<li>CMS (content management system)</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"examples\">Examples</h5>\n<p> Some examples of online marketing campaigns include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Canon advertises for search keywords related to “photography” on Google, Yahoo, and Bing search engines to market their cameras to a relevant audience.</li>\n<li>Whole Foods collects email addresses on their website to advertise new products, sales, and events in their stores.</li>\n<li>Dove creates video advertisements and shares them with their audience on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks to promote favorable conversation about their brand and products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Although online marketing creates many opportunities for businesses to grow their presence via the Internet and build their audiences, there are also inherent challenges with these methods of marketing. First, the marketing can become impersonal, due to the virtual nature of message and content delivery to a desired audience. Marketers must inform their strategy for online marketing with a strong understanding of their customer’s needs and preferences. Techniques like surveys, user testing, and in-person conversations can be used for this purpose.</p>\n<p> Online marketing can also be crowded and competitive. Although the opportunities to provide goods and services in both local and far-reaching markets is empowering, the competition can be significant. Companies investing in online marketing may find visitors’ attention is difficult to capture due to the number of business also marketing their products and services online. Marketers must develop a balance of building a unique value proposition and brand voice as they test and build marketing campaigns on various channels.</p>\n<h5 id=\"how-to-get-started\">How to Get Started</h5>\n<p> The first step to getting started with online marketing is to evaluate your goals and make sure they are measurable. Are you hoping to sign up 100 new customers? Generate 1,000 leads to fuel your B2B sales process? Build an email subscriber base of 10,000 people?</p>\n<p> After that, you need to make a choice about how to construct an online presence that helps you achieve that goal. Maybe you need to set up an e-commerce site. If you’re interested in publishing content to drive awareness and subscribers, look into setting up a blog. A simple website or landing page with a lead capture form can help you start developing your brand and generating traffic. A basic analytics platform (like Google Analytics, which is free) can help you start to measure how you are tracking towards your initial goal.</p>\n<h5 id=\"disambiguation\">Disambiguation</h5>\n<p> Online marketing is also known as Internet marketing, web marketing, digital marketing and search engine marketing (SEM.) Online advertising and Internet advertising are one technique involved with online marketing, but are not synonymous with online marketing.</p>\n","layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/seo":{"layout_script":"seo.js","layout_body_class":["seo-layout"],"TR_layout_header":"Start using Optimizely to test your website today!"}}},"/website/resources/website-optimization/index":{"TR_seo_title":"What is Website Optimization?","TR_visible_title":"What is Website Optimization?","HTML_page_content":"<h4 id=\"website-optimization-defined\">Website Optimization Defined</h4>\n<p>Website optimization is the process of using controlled experimentation to improve a website’s ability to drive business goals. To improve the performance of their website, website owners implement A/B testing to experiment with variations on pages of their website to determine which changes will ultimately result in an increase in engagement, clicks, purchases, or other type of action.</p>\n<p>Website optimization offers many measurable business benefits. First, the process of website optimization determines the best version of web page elements that help visitors to accomplish a certain goal. Optimization improves the efficiency of the website at converting visitor traffic into email subscribers, readers, or paying customers. In turn, improved efficiency leads to greater ROI on customer acquisition and traffic-generating campaigns such as web searches, AdWords, social media, and email marketing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-goals-of-optimization\">The Goals of Optimization</h4>\n<p>The goals of a website will vary depending upon the type of business, the business’ target customers, and the desired action of that audience: a purchase, filling out a form, or reading an article. The desired action of a website visitor can also be <b>conversions</b>, or the number of audience members who complete a certain action. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An online publication practices website optimization with the conversion goal of increasing the number of articles visitors read.</li>\n<li>An online store optimizes its website to encourage completion of checkouts and repeat purchases.</li>\n<li>An online software company optimizes its website to improve the rate at which visitors sign up for (or convert to) a free trial of the product.</li>\n<li>An insurance company optimizes its website to capture more potential leads for insurance coverage sales.</li>\n<li>A fundraising campaign optimizes their donation form to encourage more donations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-optimization-process\">The Optimization Process</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/optimizely-marketer-assets.cloudvent.net/raw/seo-pages/optimization%20flywheel.png\" alt=\"The Optimization Flywheel\"></p>\n<p>To do this, a website owner will conduct quantitative and qualitative research on key pages of the website that affect the ultimate goal of the site. For instance, the homepage is often a valuable area to conduct A/B tests, since much of the website’s traffic arrives on this page first. It is important that visitors immediately understand what the company offers, and that they can find their way to the second step (a click.)</p>\n<p>After identifying the top-level goal to improve, the website owner identifies under-performing points on a web page and begins to formulate a hypothesis for how these elements could be tested to improve conversions. Changes can be created in variations and run as experiments in an A/B split testing tool.</p>\n<p>The results of an experiment will show whether or not the changes to the website element produced an improvement. A winning variation can become the new baseline, and tested iteratively as more ideas for improvement are generated. A losing test is still a valuable learning opportunity, and can provide direction on what to try next in the optimization process.</p>\n<h4 id=\"elements-of-websites-to-optimize\">Elements of Websites to Optimize</h4>\n<p>Depending on the company’s goal, website optimization could include testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A headline, or key messages related to the company’s value proposition.</li>\n<li>The use of visual media, like photography or a video.</li>\n<li>The length of a form, varying the number of required fields or the order of completion.</li>\n<li>The visual style, text, and placement of a call to action (CTA) button or link.</li>\n<li>The organization of the website’s navigation.</li>\n<li>The placement of social sharing functionality.</li>\n<li>The appearance and organization of the webpage for a visitor on a mobile device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Landing pages for marketing campaigns are also often an area of a website that can be optimized, because of the high-quality traffic that is being sent there by ads, email, or social media. Website owners can also conduct website optimization on multi-page processes on their websites, like a free trial signup, a checkout funnel, or any multi-page form.</p>\n<h4 id=\"disambiguation\">Disambiguation</h4>\n<p>Website optimization is also sometimes used to describe the practice of improving the discoverability of a website for search engines, with the ultimate goal of improving search result rankings for key search terms.</p>\n<p>Website optimization can also be connected to improving the speed and reliability of a website’s performance. This is implicitly relevant to the goal of website optimization as the completion of a desired action on a website. Poor website performance, such as latency or errors, can prohibit visitors from taking action due to an inability to navigate the website.</p>\n","layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/seo":{"layout_script":"seo.js","layout_body_class":["seo-layout"],"TR_layout_header":"Start using Optimizely to test your website today!"}}},"/website/partners/solutions/33-sticks/index":{"TR_industry":"Test development, Strategic consulting","HTML_page_content":"<p>33 Sticks is a small and flexible analytics boutique partnering with Fortune 500 companies, startups, investors, and agencies to help companies make informed decisions and maximize profits through optimized user experiences.</p>\n","layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/partners":{"layout_script":false,"layout_body_class":["integrations-solutions"]}}},"/website/partners/solutions/acr-analytics-llc/index":{"TR_industry":"Full service, Test development, Strategic consulting","HTML_page_content":"<p>ACR Analytics is a highly experienced consultancy that has been delivering Digital Marketing solutions since 2008.

It is a method to validate that any new design or change to an element on your webpage is improving your conversion rate before you make that change to your site code.</p>\n<p>Testing takes the guesswork out of website optimization and enables data-backed decisions that shift business conversations from “we think” to “we know.” By measuring the impact that changes have on your metrics such as sign-ups, downloads, purchases, or whatever else your goals may be, you can ensure that every change produces positive results. Quantitative data speaks for itself. You and your coworkers may have hunches about how site visitors will respond to certain design elements; A/B testing allows you to show visitors two versions of the same page and let them determine the winner. Constantly testing and optimizing your page can increase revenue, donations, leads, registrations, downloads, and user generated content, while providing teams with valuable insight about their visitors.</p>\n<h4 id=\"here-s-how-it-works-\">Here’s how it works:</h4>\n<p><img src=\"http://optimizely-marketer-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/pages/split-testing/withoptimizely.png\" alt=\"How it works\"></p>\n<p>An A/B test involves testing two versions of a web page — an A version (the control) and a B version (the variation) — with live traffic and measuring the effect each version has on your conversion rate. Start an A/B test by identifying a goal for your company then determine which pages on your site contribute to the successful completion of that goal.</p>\n<p>Imagine a company, Acme Widgets, that operates a web store selling widgets. The company’s ultimate goal is to sell more widgets and increase their yearly revenue, thus the checkout funnel is the first place Acme’s head of marketing will focus the optimization efforts.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;buy&rdquo; button on each product page is the first element visitors interact with at the start of the checkout process. The team hypothesizes that making the button more prominent on the page would lead to more clicks and therefore more purchases. Using Optimizely, the team simply makes the button red in variation 1 and leaves the button grey in the original. They quickly set up an AB test using an <a href=\"/dist/resources/ab-testing-tool/\" title=\"A/B testing tool\">AB testing tool</a> that pits the two variations against each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://optimizely-marketer-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/pages/split-testing/three_screens.png\" alt=\"With Optimizely\"></p>\n<p>As the test runs, all visitors to the Acme Widgets site are bucketed into a variation. They are equally divided between the red button page and the original page. Optimizely measures the number of visitors who saw each version of the button and then clicked it. It also measures the number of visitors who completed the purchase funnel and landed on the “Thank You” confirmation page.</p>\n<p>Once enough visitors have run through the test and Optimizely indicates that the results are statistically significant, the Acme team ends the test and is able to declare a winner. The results show that 4.5% of visitors clicked on the red buy button and 1% clicked on the original version. The red “Buy” button led to a significant uplift in conversion rate, so Acme then redesigns their product pages accordingly. In subsequent A/B tests, Acme will apply the insight that red buttons convert better on their site than grey buttons.</p>\n<p>What assumptions are you making about your site right now? Load your site into the <a href=\"/dist/\">Optimizely editor</a>, click “Test it Out” and see how simple it is to set up an AB test or <a href=\"/dist/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test\">multivariate test</a> with Optimizely.

By separating experiments from production code, Optimizely dramatically speeds up the time to implement testing, since you don't have to redeploy code every time you want to run a test. It also helps keep you organized by not cluttering up production code with experiments.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">Can I integrate Optimizely with a third party analytics service such as Omniture SiteCatalyst or Google Analytics?</a>\n                <div class=\"answer\">\n                    <p>Yes, Optimizely can be integrated with third party analytics services such as Google Analytics and Adobe Omniture SiteCatalyst.

It takes approximately 100 ms to load, and should not noticeably impact your page load times.  Here are some of the ways Optimizely is built for speed:</p>\n                    <p>- Your Optimizely script is completely static, and is delivered through a content delivery network. The first load should take approximately 100 ms.</p>\n                    <p>- Because your Optimizely script is static, it is cached for your visitors after the first request. This means that your visitors will not load the script more than the first time, until you make changes to your experiment.</p>\n                    <p>- Your Optimizely script is small, typically weighing between 25kb and 35kb, depending on the number of experiments you are running.</p>\n                    <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040395\">\"How will Optimizely affect my page load times?\"</a></p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">How many experiments can I run at one time?</a>\n                <div class=\"answer\">\n                    <p>There is no limit on the number of experiments you can run concurrently.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">Does Optimizely support multivariate testing or is it just for A/B testing?</a>\n                <div class=\"answer\">\n                    <p>Optimizely supports multivariate testing at the Gold and Platinum plans. Additionally, there is no limit on the number of A/B tests you can run concurrently. For more information on how to run a <a href=\"{{linkPath}}/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test\">multivariate test</a>, see <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040135\">\"How can I create a multivariate test?\"</a></p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">How does Optimizely's tracking work?</a>\n                <div class=\"answer\">\n                    <p>Optimizely uses both first and third party cookies to uniquely identify visitors. When a new visitor comes to a page with an experiment, they get bucketed into\n                    one of the active variations.  Each time a visitor takes an action that you are tracking, a tracking beacon is sent to Optimizely.  We then log the event data.  This data is statistically interpreted and presented to you on the results page. Individual users can opt out of Optimizely for your domain at the <a href=\"{{linkPath}}/opt-out\">opt out</a> page.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">How are \"monthly visitors\" counted?</a>\n                <div class=\"answer\">\n                    <p>\"Monthly visitors\" are counted as the number of unique visitors that use Optimizely in a month, by being bucketed into at least one experiment on your website. This uses cookies to uniquely identify visitors. For Platinum plans, monthly visitors are defined by the Authorization Form.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <a class=\"question\">I have millions of page views per month.

Since the Optimizely script is hosted on Akamai, a global content delivery network (CDN), we can scale very well for delivery of the snippet.  The tracking calls are made asynchronously to our tracking servers on Amazon EC2, where we also have the ability to scale capacity seamlessly with usage.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"shadow-cta\">\n          <h4>Learn more about Optimizely</h4>\n          <a href=\"https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"primary-button\">Visit the Knowledge Base</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n","layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/faq":{"layout_script":false,"layout_body_class":false,"TR_faq_navigation":[{"TR_text":"Getting Started","url":"/gettingstarted"},{"TR_text":"Webinar Signup","url":"/resources/live-demo-webinar"},{"TR_text":"FAQ","url":"/faq"},{"TR_text":"Knowledge Base","url":"https://help.optimizely.com"},{"TR_text":"API Documentation","url":"http://developers.optimizely.com"},{"TR_text":"Blog","url":"http://blog.optimizely.com","swap_id":"faq-subnav-blog"}]}}},"/website/feature-list/index":{"TR_visible_title":"Full Feature List","TR_seo_title":"Full Feature List","TR_og_title":"Full Feature List","modals":["contact_sales_thank_you","downgrade_plan","downgrade_plan_confirm","pricing_plan_signup_thank_you"],"layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/no-sub-nav":{"layout_script":false,"layout_body_class":false}}},"/website/features-and-plans/index":{"TR_visible_title":"Features and Plans","TR_seo_title":"Features and Plans","TR_og_title":["Features and Plans"],"TR_og_description":["Get started optimizing instantly, or build a custom plan for your business."],"modals":["contact_sales_thank_you","downgrade_plan","downgrade_plan_confirm","pricing_plan_signup_thank_you"],"layouts":{"/website-guts/templates/layouts/wrapper":{"layout_modals":["signin_modal","signup_modal","create_experiment","reset_password","error_modal","contact_sales"]},"/website-guts/templates/layouts/no-sub-nav-optional-page-header":{"layout_script":false,"layout_body_class":false}}},"/website/free-trial/index":{"TR_seo_title":"Optimizely: Test it Out","TR_form_header":"Test it Out for Free","TR_form_text":"Welcome to Optimizely.

Incoming traffic to the website is distributed between the original (control) and the different variations without any of the visitors knowing that they are part of an experiment. The tester waits for a statistically significant difference in behavior to emerge. The results from each variation are compared to determine which version showed the greatest improvement.</p>\n <div style=\"position:relative; width: 100%; padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n <iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nhxm37fk3v\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"wistia_embed\" name=\"wistia_embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" oallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\"></iframe>\n </div>\n\n<p> This marketing methodology is frequently used to test changes to signup forms, registration pages, calls to action, or any other parts of a website where a measurable goal can be improved. For example, testing changes to an online checkout flow would help to determine what factors increase conversions from one page to the next and will lead to increased orders for the website owner.</p>\n<p> Seemingly subjective choices about web design can be made objective using split testing, since the data collected from experiments will either support or undermine a hypothesis on which design will work best. Demonstrating ROI (return on investment) for a testing platform can be measured easily because tests are created with a quantifiable goal in mind.</p>\n<p> Within webpages, nearly every element can be changed for a split test. Marketers and web developers may try testing:</p>\n<p> <a href=\"/dist/resources/split-testing-tool\" title=\"Split Testing Tool\">Split testing tools</a> allow for variations to be targeted at specific groups of visitors, delivering a more tailored and personalized experience. The web experience of these visitors is improved through testing, as indicated by the increased likelihood that they will complete a certain action on the site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual elements: pictures, videos, and colors</li>\n<li>Text: headlines, calls to action, and descriptions</li>\n<li>Layout: arrangement and size of buttons, menus, and forms</li>\n<li><p>Visitor flow: how a website user gets from point A to B</p>\n<p>Some split testing best practices include:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Elimination: fewer page elements create less distractions from the conversion goal</p>\n</li>\n<li>Focus on the call to action: text resonates differently depending on the audience</li>\n<li>Aim for the global maximum: test with the overarching goal of the website in mind, not the goals of individual pages</li>\n<li><p>Provide symmetric and consistent experiences: make testing changes consistent throughout the visitor flow to improve conversions at every step of the process</p>\n<p>Habitual testing for a website owner or business helps to build a culture of data-informed decision-making that takes into account audience preferences. Each click on a website is a data point from a potential customer. Conflicting opinions can be put to the test with split testing methodology, and the visitors to the website will inform the final decision on the “best” design.</p>\n<p>Split testing is equivalent to performing a controlled experiment, a methodology that can be applied to more than just web pages. The concept of split testing originated with direct mail and print advertising campaigns, which were tracked with a different phone number for each version. Currently, you can split test banner and text ads, television commercials, email subject lines, and web products.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/dist/\" title=\"Optimizely\">Optimizely</a> is a tool that makes creating, running, and reporting split tests easy.
